The downward rotation of the eyeball is associated with the negative deflection. The time course of the deflections is similar to the time course of the eyeball movement.

In EEG, the artifact produced by the tongue has a broad potential field that drops from frontal to occipital areas, although it is less steep than that produced by eye movement artifacts. The amplitude of the potentials is greater inferiorly than in parasagittal regions; the frequency is variable but usually in the delta range. Chewing and sucking can produce similar artifacts.
HED_0012512	3	Nonbiological-artifact	Data-artifact		A data artifact arising from a non-biological source.
