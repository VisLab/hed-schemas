HED_0040011	ScorePrologue		HedPrologue	This schema is a Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) Library Schema implementation of Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE)(1-2) for describing events occurring during neuroimaging time series recordings.\nThe HED-SCORE library schema allows the annotation of electrophysiology recordings using terms from an internationally accepted set of defined terms (SCORE) compatible with the HED framework .\nThe resulting annotations are understandable to clinicians and directly usable in computer analysis.\n\nFuture extensions may be implemented in the HED-SCORE library schema.\nFor more information see https://hed-schema-library.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.
HED_0040012	ScoreEpilogue		HedEpilogue	The Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE) is a standard terminology for scalp EEG data assessment designed for use in clinical practice that may also be used for research purposes.\nThe SCORE standard defines terms for describing phenomena observed in scalp EEG data. It is also potentially applicable (with some suitable extensions) to EEG recorded in critical care and neonatal settings.\nThe SCORE standard received European consensus and has been endorsed by the European Chapter of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN) and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Commission on European Affairs.\nA second revised and extended version of SCORE achieved international consensus.\n\nTPA KR DH SM July 2024
