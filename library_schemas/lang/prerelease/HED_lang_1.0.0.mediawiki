'''Prologue'''
The HED Language schema is a Hierarchical Event Descriptors Library Schema Language stimuli and experiments. The schema allows for detailed annotation of neuroimaging experiments that involve language events from carefully controlled experiments specifically targeting the neuroscience of language processing to more complex naturalistic paradigms that involve written or spoken language. HED Language schema allows for annotation of language stimuli on different levels through the orthogonal definition of Language-units and Language-unit-properties. Full sentences can be annotated with sentence-level characteristics while the individual words in the sentence can simultaneously be associated with word-level characteristics. Annotation possibilities are extensive and cover characteristics of multiple languages allowing for comparisons between languages.
