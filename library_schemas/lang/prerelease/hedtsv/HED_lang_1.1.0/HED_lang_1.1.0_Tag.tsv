HED_0062228	Orthographic-type	1	Language-property	annotation=dc:source Original, annotation=rdfs:comment Classification of writing systems is complex and these categories are not universally accepted (mainly because most writing systems have characteristics of multiple of these categories). However most writing systems have an overall tendency towards one of these categories and so the categories can be useful to see how large differences are managed by the individuals who speak them. But it is normal that a writing system does not cleanly fit into any of these categories.	The type of language item each symbol serves to represent in written language.
